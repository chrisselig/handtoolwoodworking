## Preamble

I grew up in a multi-generational house, in Nova Scotia, Canada, where my grandfather had a barn with tonnes of woodworking tools: both power and hand. I had no idea what any of these weird tools were used for (except of course, the table saw) and no interest in learning about them. 

However, I was amazed that my grandfather could build things with them. He used to make these chairs and give they away and some of them ended up far away in New England and New York. I wish I had a picture of them. He would grab branches from the woods behind the house and whittle away all the bark and curve them around to build some of the backing and arms of the chair. I couldn't even find a similar idea on the Interwebs. He also built a chair swings, what were similar to the below (except didn't have a table in the middle).

Fast forward many years. As I entered my 30s, I started to realize that I was interested in building things from wood... which, for those that know me, is an odd thought. I'm not handy in any way and never work with my hands, unless typing on a keyboard counts? My hands are soft and have never seen a day of honest work in their life and I couldn't tell you what a Phillips head screw driver is, except it is a screw driver.

It wasn't until 2021 that I both owned a house and had the financial capacity to start investing into woodworking.

The post and website it dedicated to my journey. You can see all my mistakes: tearout, miscut length of boards, non-square boxes, non-parallell sides and every and any other mistake that can possibly be made. Hopefully, by the end, there will be some reasonable successes in my woodworking journey.

## How it started

In May 2021 I bought my first hand toools and books off of Amazon. I bought the ["The Minimalist Woodworker"](https://www.amazon.ca/Minimalist-Woodworker-Essential-Tools-Building/dp/1951217063/ref=asc_df_1951217063/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459515175785&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=505858475614582672&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9001309&hvtargid=pla-1029239825921&psc=1). I also bought a couple of Japanese saws, a terrible Jack Plane that I couldn't get flat or the blade sharp (it wasn't a well made blade), sharpening stones (from Lee Valley), chisels, marking gauge and some Pine from a big box store. I was ready to begin.

I read The Minimalist Woodworker and decided to build the saw bench and bent as my first two projects. I didn't have a work shop so i just built it in my office, which was nice because I went from my job and 2 feet away to my new hobby. Unfortunately, it was also really messy. Below is my initial shop setup. Sexy, right?

## The Results

I learned, after trying to build items from a book (without prior experience), that it is not the way for me to learn woodworking. It was no fault of the book. I just learn woodworking better from videos. I thought since I can learn coding and other data concepts from books I could just do the same with woodworking... I was wrong.

My first project was the saw bench. Below are two images of it.

Some mistakes you will notice:

1. Wood is not cut to the correct sizes to match each other

2. Screws split the wood in various spots (no pilot holes)

3. Wood is a bit cupped in places

4. Nothing is planed smooth, but it was 4DS (dressed on 4 sides) so it isn't bad, except for the end grain.

5. It's not really the correct height for me, which I didn't understand while building it

Probably alot more mistakes, but you get the general idea of my awesome skills. 


The second project I built was the saw bent, to go along with it.

The bent is supposed to be the same height as the saw bench so I can put longer boards on it while sawing them... it isn't the same height, at all. I could go plane it down now, I suppose but in the courses I'm taking, I'm going to build new ones (stay tuned). It didn't turn out that bad. The mortoise and tenon don't fit quite right but for doing them all without any technique, it seems ok.

## Where I'm going

During these first two projects I decided I needed to find a better way to learn. I started looking for places to learn, either locally or online. Everything local I found was related to power tools, which I'm not interested in. Even if there would have been some good hand tool woodworking courses locally, they would have been shut down because of Covid-19 anyway.

I did come across Shannon Rogers, [The Renaissance Woodworker](https://www.renaissancewoodworker.com/). He has an online [hand tool school](https://www.handtoolschool.net/). I started watching some of his free videos and I liked his style, so signed up for a month. I'm still signed up and I love it. The videos and the community is great so if anyone is interested in learning hand tool woodworking, this is the place to go!

I should note though, any failures in my woodworking are not from the Handtool School. I just suck at woodworking.

After signing up, I started the Orientation Semester of the school. Stay tuned for another post on that journey and it's projects. Hint, my first project in this course is my workbench.
