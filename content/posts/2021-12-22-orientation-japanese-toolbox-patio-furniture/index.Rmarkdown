The focus of this post will be to discuss various projects that I feel do not warrent their own posts. These projects include:

1. Japanese Toolbox

2. Bench hooks

3. Picnic benches and table

## The Japanese Toolbox

With my "shiny" new [workbench](https://agitated-bassi-8b2343.netlify.app/2021/12/19/index.en-us/) completed, it was time to move onto the project I was most looking forward to: the Japanese toolbox.

By this point, I had an assortment of tools and literally no place to put anything in my garage so stuff was strewn everywhere. The project came at the right time.

I never imagined I would say this, but I became interested in nails during this project. Nails? Seriously? I know, weird. The toolbox uses [wrought](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wrought_nails) and [cut](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cut_nail) nails, not modern (shitty) round nails. This types of nails, not only add alot of holding power (more than modern nails), they give the toolbox a more historical look. The drawback of them is they are really easy to split the wood if you don't drill proper pilot holes (I didn't drill proper pilot holes). Should really practice the pilot holes and nails before you put them on the work (I didn't do this, huge mistake).

Anyway, the toolbox came out ok. I realized I am uncordinated so when I tried to hold the box together and fastent it, things didn't end up square (partly because I didn't do a good job with the sawing/planing) but also because I didn't clamp them properly to do the joining.

Below is the toolbox.

You can see, especially on the nails on the left, the splitting of the wood. I got better with those nails after, I promise. The toolbox is all made out of pine, but I would like to eventually make another out of a nice hardwood.

Anyway, I'm surprised with how well the top ended up. The piece that slides in and locks... actually fits and locks the top in place. Yay!

Minus the mistakes, the handle being loose, for example, I really liked how this turned out and I actually started building some confidence that maybe I can actually build stuff. Maybe.

## Other Projects

### Sloyd Bench Hooks

The Sloyd bench hooks is a saw and chisel exercise. They are a multi-purpose bench tool where I can hold wood off the bench and saw, for example.

This is the first exercise where I used hardwood. Instead of picking a handtool friendly one, I had previously ordered a random box of hardwood from [KJP Select Hardwoods](https://kjpselecthardwoods.com/) and just picked a couple pieces out at random. I'm unsure what they are, but they were really tough to work with.

Long story short, these Sloyd hooks did not turn out, at all. They took **way** too long to chisel out, even after making many morton cuts. The two hooks are not even the same height so holding work on two is precarious at best. I tried to use them a few times, then threw them in the corner. I haven't had the heart (yet) to recycle them.

without further ado, take a gander:

## Patio Chair / Picnic Tables & Benches

At this point, summer was in full swing and we had no outdoor furniture. So, instead of going out and buying some nice stuff that will probably fall apart in a couple years, I decided to build my own, that will probably fall apart in a few years.

A Rona near me has a box of \$3 offcuts outside the store. I ended up buying alot of this wood over the summer and the two benches, picnic table and patio chair were made entirely of them. In total, I believe all 4 only required \$150 in wood. Not bad for 4 pieces of furniture. 


I started with a patio chair. This is where I discovered I cannot measure an angle.

Eagled eyed observers will notice that the back of the chair is at an extreme angle. It's pretty uncomfortable. The original design had two normal arms, but because of the extreme back angle I took the arms off, and added a cup holder (random piece hardwood!) or a book holder, while breaking your back sitting outside.

Next up, I developed the first bench. The bench had a similar infrastructure as my workbench.

It actually turned out pretty well except for the joinery not fighting quite right, but it is stable, and that's all I asked for in a bench.

For the picnic table, I wanted to try a different design. As an aside, I discovered I do not like building the same thing over and over again... so I'm probably never building furniture to sell on Etsy. 

I opted to build one with X shaped legs. It didn't look very hard in the pics, so off I went.


![Picnic Table](picnic_table.jpg)

The X legs didn't turn out too bad, but they are not even so the table is a little wobbly. **BUT**, my backyard stones are not level either, so if you set it down just right, it works out quite well. I totally planned it that way. I ended up adding an underside shelf and some more support around the legs because it fault a little easy to break. Now's its solid, plus I have some storage.

I ended up building a second bench, but I forgot to take a pic of it. It turned out even better than the first one, which made me happy. It does seem like I am improving, even though all I see is faults with my work.

That's it for today, thanks for reading!
